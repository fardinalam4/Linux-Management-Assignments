Linux Management Assignments

First, I created a new Azure account using my HAMK student email at portal.azure.com. I started with the free 30-day trial, which gave me some credits to use on Azure services. Then, I applied for additional Azure for Students credits by logging into Azure with my student account and adding the Azure for Students subscription.
Once I had the credits, I went to the homepage of the Azure portal and created a new virtual machine. I selected Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Gen 2 from the Marketplace, published by Canonical. I named my machine Ubuntu1 and chose the Standard_B2ls_v2 size for the VM. I made sure to enable SSH access and set up a public IP address. For the login, I created a username and an SSH key for secure access. I also created a new resource group and subnet for the machine.
After the machine was ready, I tested the SSH connection using PuTTY, a program that allows me to connect to the VM. I downloaded PuTTY from the official website and used the username and SSH key I had set up earlier to log in.
Finally, I wrote down all the steps in a markdown file and uploaded it to a GitHub repository. I included the link to my GitHub in my submission.

Submission:
I have submitted the link to my GitHub repository, which contains the markdown file with the installation steps and confirmation of the successful SSH connection.
